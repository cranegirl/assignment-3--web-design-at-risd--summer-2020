      <h1>Ten Principles for Good Design</h1>
      <h2>by Dieter Rams</h2>

      <h1>Good design…</h1>
         <br id="1"><span>1. Is innovative. </span>The possibilities for progression are not, by any means, exhausted. Technological development is always offering new opportunities for original designs. But imaginative design always develops in tandem with improving technology, and can never be an end in itself. <br> <img src="img/1.jpg" alt="[Photo of a desktop computer.]"> <p>Image credit: <a href="https://unsplash.com/@carlheyerdahl">Carl Heyerdahl on Unsplash</a> </p>
         <br id="2"><span>2. Makes a product useful.</span> A product is bought to be used. It has to satisfy not only functional, but also psychological and aesthetic criteria. Good design emphasizes the usefulness of a product whilst disregarding anything that could detract from it. <br> <img src="img/2.jpg" alt="[Photo of person holding a bottle of hand sanitizer.]"> <p>Image credit: <a href="https://unsplash.com/@kellysikkema">Kelly Sikkema on Unsplash</a> </p>
         <br id="3"><span>3. Is aesthetic.</span> The aesthetic quality of a product is integral to its usefulness because products are used every day and have an effect on people and their well-being. Only well-executed objects can be beautiful. <br> <img src="img/3.jpg" alt="[Photo of a banana on a pink background.]"> <p>Image credit: <a href="https://unsplash.com/@dorner">Mike Dorner on Unsplash</a> </p>
         <br id="4"><span>4. Makes a product understandable.</span> It clarifies the product’s structure. Better still, it can make the product clearly express its function by making use of the user’s intuition. At best, it is self-explanatory. <br> <img src="img/4.jpg" alt="[Photo of a person standing on an arrow painted on a road.]"> <p>Image credit: <a href="https://unsplash.com/@smartphotocourses">Smart on Unsplash</a> </p>
         <br id="5"><span>5. Is unobtrusive.</span> Products fulfilling a purpose are like tools. They are neither decorative objects nor works of art. Their design should therefore be both neutral and restrained, to leave room for the user’s self-expression. <br> <img src="img/5.jpg" alt="[Photo of a blank notebook and a pen.]"> <p>Image credit: <a href="https://unsplash.com/@m15ky">Mike Tinnion on Unsplash</a> </p>
